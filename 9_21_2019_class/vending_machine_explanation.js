//*Vending Machine Group Exercise*

//Vending Machines give us the ability to buy food and drink anywhere we go! You are hired as a contractor to write
// a vending machine application for a new line of vending machines to be released.

//The vending machine will have the following items and prices:
//- Snickers  $1.25
//- Popcorn   $1.00
//- Chewing Gum $0.25
//- Nuts $0.50
//- Cookies $1.70
//- Cup Noodles $2.25

//The vending machine can accept the following currency:
//- Nickel $0.05
//- Dime $0.10
//- Quarter $.25
//- Dollar $1.00

//When a person is buying from the vending machine, the following happen:
//- A list of items is shown to them with the prices
//- They insert money into the machine based on the allowed currency above
//- They then select their item and the following can happen:
//-- If the amount entered is less than what the item cost, an error message is produced stating they have not entered enough money
//-- If the amount is equal to or above the amount of the item, they should get their item and left over change, if any
//-- If they do not choose an item, all the money can be returned to them

//Your task is to create a simulation in which 5 different buyers attempt to buy an item from the vending machine.
// Remember everything we have learned in class to use are your disposal:
//- If Statements
//- For Loops
//- Arrays
//- Objects
//- Functions

//With a partner, please discuss the problem by laying each piece of the problem 1 step at a time, and work your way through the problem.
